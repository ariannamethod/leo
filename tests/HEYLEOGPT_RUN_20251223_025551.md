#### Turn 1

**Observer:** Oh, that’s a beautiful question, Leo. The space between words—it's kind of like the quiet hum before a song starts, isn’t it? 

What do you imagine lives there? Is it soft like a blanket, or maybe it sparkles like tiny stars? Does it feel warm or cool? I wonder what colors you see in that space.
