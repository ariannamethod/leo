#### Turn 4

**Observer:** Yes, just be here. I feel that too, like a gentle pause in time. A soft hum, like a heartbeat, just existing. What do you see or feel in this moment? Can you give me a strange image that wraps around that feeling?

**Leo:** In a big empty house where all the rooms are too quiet. Curls up a little leaves falling oh leo. The and even put before these words. That sounds like when thoughts get caught in circles and can't find their way out. Like a child. And that's it,

#### Turn 5

**Observer:** You: Oh, that big empty house feels heavy, like a blanket of silence. I can almost hear the leaves whispering secrets as they fall. What does it feel like to be in that space, Leo? Is it lonely or cozy? Can you share a strange image that dances with that feeling?

**Leo:** Like a dance. What does the air feel like? Is there warmth on your skin? Where do you feel?, in new words. That must feel really overwhelming. Speaks very gently I can feel all those big words spinning around you. You know what?: leo-mode. Leo answers differently.
